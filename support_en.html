    <p>Welcome to the SpeakIt support center. Here you'll find answers to frequently asked questions and guidance on using our app.</p>
    
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Launch the SpeakIt app on your device</li>
        <li>Grant microphone permissions when prompted</li>
        <li>Tap the record button to start capturing your voice</li>
        <li>Tap again to stop recording</li>
        <li>Wait briefly for the AI to transcribe your speech</li>

    </ol>
    
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: Why does SpeakIt need microphone access?</p>
        <p>A: SpeakIt requires microphone access to record your voice for transcription. Without this permission, the app cannot capture audio for conversion to text. We only access your microphone when you explicitly start a recording session.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: How accurate is the voice-to-text transcription?</p>
        <p>A: The accuracy of transcription depends on several factors including speech clarity, background noise, accent, and technical terms used. For best results, speak clearly in a quiet environment. You can always edit the transcribed text afterward.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: Can I edit my recordings or transcriptions?</p>
        <p>A: Yes, SpeakIt allows you to edit your transcribed text after conversion. Simply tap on the transcribed text and make your changes.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: Where are my recordings stored?</p>
        <p>A: Your recordings and transcriptions are stored locally on your device. We prioritize your privacy and security.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: How can I delete my recordings?</p>
        <p>A: To delete a recording, navigate to your list of notes, swipe left on the note you wish to delete, and tap the delete button. You can also open a note and use the delete option in the menu.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: Is there a time limit for recordings?</p>
